# Overview

This DAO proposal is to provide clarification and expectations to participants in ETHDenver2023 #BUIDLathon (hackathon) WRT: $RETOKEN rewards + bounty proceeds (if any are awarded / received).

# ETHDenver2023 #BUIDLathon (hackathon)

üìä We will utilize Coordinape to determine the allocatation of rewards for the following two categories ($RETOKEN + any bounty proceeds).

[What is Coordinape?](https://www.notion.so/What-is-Coordinape-56a0411a71f748d699c2b01e58012165)

## $RETOKEN (REtokenDAO Social Token)

We will allocate 8,000 $RETOKEN to be distributed to ETHDenver #BUIDLathon TEAM members.  The distribution will occur based upon their coordinape contributions as determined by the TEAM.  We may create ad-hoc events with additional $RETOKEN incentives that the entire REtokenDAO community can participate in (such as Working Groups <Zoom / LiveStream> as we have done in the past for various REtokenDAO initiatives).

## Bounty Proceeds

We will allocate any bounty proceeds to be divide wholly amongst the TEAM participants based upon their coordinape participation.

**Example:**

TEAM wins $10,000 in bounty proceeds.

- TEAM Member A receives 40% of Coordinape GIVes, they will receive $4,000.
- TEAM Member B receives 25% of Coordinape GIVes, they will receive $2,500.
- TEAM Member C receives 15% of Coordinape GIVes, they will receive $1,500.
- TEAM Member D receives 20% of Coordinape GIVes, they will receive $2,000

## TEAM(s)

As of 27Feb2023, we are still seeking additional TEAM members to contribute what we are planning to #BUIDL.  We will be hosting a TEAM Working Group <Zoom / LiveStream> on 27Feb2023 that will move some of our conversation forward (TEAM selection, bounty finalization, direction for remaining of week).

We are planning on submitted (2) TEAMs, but depending on the week progresses and any additional interest (or lack of), we may scale back to a single TEAM.  Either way, we will utilize a single Coordinape circle + Epoch to determine TEAM contribution efforts.  Regardless of whether a bounty is won on ‚ÄúTEAM Exchange‚Äù or ‚ÄúTEAM RETCLUB‚Äù (or whatever we call the TEAMs), any $RETOKEN / bounty proceeds will be shared based upon the Coordinape contributions.

# Code Created During #BUIDLathon (hackathon)

Any code created during the ETHDenver2023 #BUIDLathon (hackathon) will be considered open source with commonly used open source licensing and will be housed on the @REtokenDAO GitHub repository.

We hope that the dynamics created during this TEAM effort will result in the desire to contribute to REtokenDAO on an ongoing basis.
